// --- Skeletons and skinning (stage 25) ---

// A skeleton is a flat array of bones. Every bone names its parent by index
// and a parent ALWAYS comes before its children, so one forward pass builds
// every world matrix — no recursion, no sorting at draw time.
//
// Two matrices matter per bone:
//   * the bind pose (where the bone was when the mesh was attached), kept as
//     its inverse because that is the only form skinning ever needs;
//   * the current local pose, which animation writes.
//
// A vertex is bound to at most kMaxBoneInfluences bones with weights that
// sum to 1. That is the usual game budget: four bones is enough for a
// shoulder or a hip, and it keeps the skinning loop tight.
